--Brief Summary of My Approach and Decisions--

I built the Locations Directory page from scratch using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. My focus was to create a simple, clean, and fully responsive layout that works smoothly across all devices.

The page includes a sticky header with a logo and navigation, a hero section with a title, a sidebar with a city search filter, and a grid of location cards. Each card displays basic information and expands smoothly to show more details when the “View Details” button is clicked. On mobile, a sticky contact button appears when a card is expanded.

The data is stored in data.php as an array, and the grid is generated dynamically through PHP. The search function works by sending a request to search.php, which filters and returns matching results in JSON. JavaScript handles updating the page without reloading.

The CSS layout uses Grid and Flexbox, with breakpoints for different screen sizes and smooth transitions for a polished feel. I kept the code organized, readable, and commented to make it easy to follow.
